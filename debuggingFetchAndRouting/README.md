  "content": "React follows semantic versioning. Typically, this means that we use patch versions for bugfixes, and minors for new (non-breaking) features. However, we reserve the option to release minor versions even if they do not include new features. The motivation is to reserve patches for changes that have a very low chance of breaking. Patches are the most important type of release because they sometimes contain critical bugfixes.",

**The following instructions are required for the tests to pass**

- Wrap the `Loader` component with an HTML container element and add the `testid` attribute value as `loader` to it as shown below

  ```jsx
  <div testid="loader">
    <Loader type="TailSpin" color="#00bfff" height={50} width={50} />
  </div>
  ```

> ### _Things to Keep in Mind_
>
> - All components you implement should go in the `src/components` directory.
> - Don't change the component folder names as those are the files being imported into the tests.
> - **Do not remove the pre-filled code**
> - Want to quickly review some of the concepts youâ€™ve been learning? Take a look at the Cheat Sheets.
