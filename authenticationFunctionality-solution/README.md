<br/>

**The following instructions are required for the tests to pass**

- `Home` route should consist of `/` in the URL path
- `Login` route should consist of `/login` in the URL path
- `About` route should consist of `/about` in the URL path
- No need to use the `BrowserRouter` in `App.js` as we have already included in `index.js`
- As this project is mainly designed for Authentication Functionality and does not contain any input fields, use the below sample user credentials to login

  - User credentials

    ```text
    username: rahul
    password: rahul@2021
    ```

> ### _Things to Keep in Mind_
>
> - All components you implement should go in the `src/components` directory.
> - Don't change the component folder names as those are the files being imported into the tests.
> - **Do not remove the pre-filled code**
> - Want to quickly review some of the concepts youâ€™ve been learning? Take a look at the Cheat Sheets.
