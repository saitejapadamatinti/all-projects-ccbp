- When an authenticated user opens the Product Item Details Route,
  - An HTTP GET request should be made to **productDetailsApiUrl** with `jwt_token` in the Cookies and product `id` as path parameter
  - **_loader_** should be displayed while fetching the data
  - After the data is fetched successfully, display the product details and similar products received in the response
  - Initially, the quantity of the product should be `1`
  - The quantity of the product should be incremented by one when the plus icon is clicked
  - The quantity of the product should be decremented by one when the minus icon is clicked
  - If the HTTP GET request made is unsuccessful, then the [Failure view](https://assets.ccbp.in/frontend/content/react-js/nxt-trendz-product-details-error-lg-output.png) should be displayed

- The `line-height` CSS property sets the height of a line box. It's commonly used to set the distance between lines of text.

  ```
  line-height: 1.5;
  ```

- `Products` Route should consist of `/products` in the URL path
- `Product Item Details` Route should consist of `/products/:id` in the URL path

   password: rahul@2021
  ```

- Non-Prime User credentials

  ```
   username: raja

- Wrap the Loader component with an HTML container element and add the `testid` attribute value as `loader` to it

  ```jsx
  <div testid="loader">
    <Loader type="ThreeDots" color="#0b69ff" height={80} width={80} />
  </div>
  ```

- The product image in Product Item Details Route should have the alt as **product**
- The similar product image in Product Item Details Route should have the alt as **similar product {product title}**

  ```example
  similar product Wide Bowknot Hat
  ```

- `BsPlusSquare`, `BsDashSquare` icons from react-icons should be used for **plus** and **minus** buttons in ProductItemDetails Route
- The Product Item Details Route should consist of two HTML button elements with `testid` attribute values as **plus** and **minus** respectively
